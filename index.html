                <p>I absolutely love Robotics and it has been a major passion of mine since I was very young. I have been doing Robotics for 3 years and am excited to create more memories.</p>

            <p>Another detail about me, is that KPOP is my type of music style. Some of my favorite KPOP groups include Stray Kids, BTS, Enhypen, and many more! Taehyung, Niki, and Felix are my favorite KPOP band members.</p>
